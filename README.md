# Sphere-Sections
This is the second of my (student ID 30400759) two coding projects for PHYS6017, on Data analysis for distribution of particle sizes. This code is not intended to be used by anyone else.


To run:

`make build`

`make bashapp`

`python All.py`

you need to have docker, docker-compose, and make. If you don't, you'll need the modules found in requirements.txt, in the config directory

If you run it this way, plots won't be displayed. To display plots, you need to install the modules in requirments.txt in the config directory, then run it in python3.
